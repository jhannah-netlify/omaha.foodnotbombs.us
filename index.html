<h1>Food Not Bombs, Omaha Nebraska USA</h1>

<p>
Since ~2000, Food Not Bombs (Omaha Nebraska) has been distributing food free of charge
on the corner of 14th and Farnum at 2pm every Sunday. Rain, snow, or shine.
We are one of hundreds (thousands?) of groups world-wide, please
see <a href="http://foodnotbombs.net">FoodNotBombs.net</a> for a map and contact information for groups around 
the world, and the history and ethos of the global organization.
<p>

<p>
We're a very small and scrappy band of volunteers. We hope you'll join us. :)
</p>

<h2>During COVID-19</h2>

<p>
Beginning in March 2020 the logistics of FNB Omaha changed drastically for everyone's safety.
Our number of volunteers has shrunk dramatically to minimize any potential spread of 
SARS-CoV-2. We still need volunteers though, especially when someone is out of town,
so <b>please contact us below!</b>
</p>

<p>
All volunteers must wear masks and gloves at all times. The compliance of our patrons... varies.
We hand out masks every week.
</p>

Saturday
<ul>
	<li>08:15 - Pick-up from grocery store, move to overnight storage.</li>
</ul>

Sunday
<ul>
	<li>12:00 - Meet at storage location to sort and pre-bag groceries</li>
	<li>14:00 - Distribute bags at 14th & Farnum</li>
	<li>15:00 - Anything left over donated to other locations</li>
</ul>

<h2>Before (and after? ...someday?) COVID-19</h2>

<p>
For many years, we were using <a href="https://tablegracecafe.com/">Table Grace Cafe</a>'s
kitchen to cook and clean, serving a meal on plates.
We hope to get back to a kitchen model at some point.
