<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The group started in 1996 as a friend of mine and I had the idea to
try to get FNB going in Nebraska. He was going to work on getting a
Lincoln group rolling while I started up the Omaha group with a few
friends. The Lincoln group didn’t last too long, unfortunately, but the
Omaha one stuck it out for the long haul. I was the only Creighton
student who was involved in those early days. A couple of the others
were still seniors in high school.</p>
<p>There were almost no internet resources back then, and we didn’t know
anyone in other FNB chapters, so what we used for inspiration and
resources at the start was the <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Food-Not-Bombs-C-Butler/dp/1884365213">FNB
book</a> by Keith McHenry and C.T. Butler. (I think this is proof that
books, especially if they contain practical ideas, can lead to real
change.) We hung photocopied fliers around town to spread the word about
our meetings, which were held at McFoster’s restaurant on Farnam because
they let us use their upstairs event room. We started sharing food as
soon as we found stores willing to hold back some unsellable produce for
us to collect. We cooked large pots of soup/stew accompanied by whatever
else we had and went down to Gene Leahy without fail with our folding
table, plywood sign painted with “Food Not Bombs” and the hand/carrot
emblem, and a stack of fliers explaining who we were and what we
did.</p>
<p>At the meetings we discussed things like potential leads for food
donations, plans for the weekly lunches at Gene Leahy, and sometimes
things like outreach. We sometimes considered expanding to two meals per
week, but it was generally agreed that it was behind our capacity. I was
fairly satisfied that we always maintained our weekly schedule of
picking up donations, cooking and sharing food each week, and dropping
off any surplus food at a local shelter.</p>
<p>I stayed involved in the group but lessened my involvement in 2000
and 2001 as I did a little traveling and then permanently left Omaha in
2002. It’s very gratifying to see that FNB Omaha has continued for over
twenty-five years now.</p>
